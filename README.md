# Software-Refactoring-Final
This code is implementation of sorting functions which are timed on how long they take to sort arrays of 100, 10000, and 1000000.

It was reused a year ago when I implemented some of the same algorithms in inline assembly to compare c++ vs assembly times.

I have grown as a programmer since this project was done. While working on implementing the assembly, I knew something had to change. Buuuuuuut I had other things to do so it did not get refactored.

So this will be me refactoring the code to be much more spread out and readable.
